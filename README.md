## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a SOC Engineer with a passion for using Python to automate security tasks. On this GitHub, you'll find a collection of my Python scripts designed to make SOC operations smoother and more efficient.

What You'll Discover:
Automation Tools: Scripts that help with common SOC tasks, like checking for vulnerabilities and analyzing logs.
